## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE DESIGN**

### **Payment System Architecture**
```
Frontend → Payment Controller → Payment Gateway → Webhook Handler → Database
```

### **Database Schema**
- `payments` table
- `payment_gateways` table
- `payment_webhooks` table
- `payment_logs` table

### **API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/v1/payments/initialize`
- `POST /api/v1/payments/verify`
- `POST /api/v1/payments/webhook`
- `GET /api/v1/payments/history`
- `GET /api/v1/payments/{id}`
